BRIEF FOR TASK DETAILS SET-OUT BELOW:-

Compulsory Task 1

In this task, we will use the MNIST database, available from this page.

As stated by the creators of the dataset, “The MNIST database of handwritten digits, available from this page, has a training set of 60,000 examples, and a test set
of 10,000 examples. It is a subset of a larger set available from NIST. The digits have been size-normalised and centred in a fixed-size image.”

Follow these steps:

● Load the MNIST dataset.

● Split the data into a training, development, and test set.

○ Add a comment explaining the purpose of the train, development and test sets

● Use the RandomForestClassifier built into SKLearn.

● Pick one parameter to tune, and explain why you chose this parameter.

● Choose which value for the parameter to set for testing on the test data and explain why.

● Print the confusion matrix for your Random Forest model on the test set.

● Report which classes the model struggles with the most.

● Report the accuracy, precision, recall, and f1-score
